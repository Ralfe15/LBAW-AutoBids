            <p>AutoBids is an online website that allows users to buy and sell vehicles through an auction system, ensuring the quality and authenticity of the vehicles.</p>
            <p>Our motivation is to create an accessible and straightforward platform, where anyone can easily buy and sell vehicles despite previous experience with auctions.</p>
            <p>The website will be inspired by the classic English Auction method, where users are able to bid until there is no time left and the highest bidder wins. </p>
